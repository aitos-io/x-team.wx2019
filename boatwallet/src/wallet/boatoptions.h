// BOAT LOG LEVEL DEFINITION
// Log level is used to control the detail of log output.
// 3 types of detail level can be specified in BoatLog():
// "CRITICAL" is for critical exceptions that may halt the wallet from going on.
// "NORMAL" is for warnings that may imply some error but could be held.
// "VERBOSE" is for detail information that is only useful for debug.
#define BOAT_LOG_NONE        0
#define BOAT_LOG_CRITICAL    1
#define BOAT_LOG_NORMAL      2
#define BOAT_LOG_VERBOSE     3

// BOAT_LOG_LEVEL is a macro that limits the log detail up to that level.
// Seting it to BOAT_LOG_NONE means outputing nothing.
#define BOAT_LOG_LEVEL BOAT_LOG_VERBOSE


// OpenSSL OPTION: Use OpenSSL for key generation
#define BOAT_USE_OPENSSL 1



// RPC USE OPTION: One and only one RPC_USE option shall be set to 1
#define RPC_USE_LIBCURL 1
#define RPC_USE_NOTHING 0

#define RPC_USE_COUNT (RPC_USE_LIBCURL + RPC_USE_NOTHING)
#if RPC_USE_COUNT != 1
#error "One and only one RPC_USE option shall be set to 1"
#endif
#undef RPC_USE_COUNT


// Mining interval and Pending transaction timeout
#define BOAT_MINE_INTERVAL 3  // Mining Interval of the blockchain, in seconds
#define BOAT_WAIT_PENDING_TX_TIMEOUT 30  // Timeout waiting for a transaction being mined, in seconds

#endif
